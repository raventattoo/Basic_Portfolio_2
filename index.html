		<p>My name is Michael Shelton. I am 49 years old and hoping to start a new career in Web Development. I practiced medicine for most of my adult life, having advanced from high school, to a 4-year undergraduate degree, and then to medical school all back to back. While certain aspects of medicine were very rewarding, other negative aspects ultimately led to my feeling "burned out". It was for this reason I took some much needed time off from my medical practice in 2011-2012. It was then I realized that I did not want to return to practice. <br>
		I was so excited to find the Coding Bootcamp program; it sounded exactly like what I needed to get me started in a new, exciting, and challenging career.</p>
