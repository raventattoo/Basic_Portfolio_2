		<p>My name is Michael Shelton. I am 49 years old and hoping to start a new career in Web Development. I practiced medicine for most of my adult life, having advanced from high school, to a 4-year undergraduate degree, and then to medical school all back to back. While certain aspects of medicine were very rewarding, I found others ultimately led me to feeling "burned out" with medical practice. This in turn led me to taking some time off a few years ago. It was then I realized that I did not want to return to practice. 
		I was so excited to find the Coding Bootcamp program; it sounded exactly like what I needed to get me started on a new, challenging, and exciting career.</p>
